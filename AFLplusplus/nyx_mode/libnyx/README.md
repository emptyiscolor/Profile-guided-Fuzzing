libnyx is a library that allows you to simply build hypervisor-based snapshot fuzzers. Using libnyx, managing multiple VMs and snapshots as well as the communication with the code running in the VM becomes a matter of a handful of lines of code. At the moment, libnyx can be used via a simple C interface or from a rust library.
